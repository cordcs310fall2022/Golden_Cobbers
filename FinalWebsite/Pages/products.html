        Pavers, or paving stones, are a versatile product that are most often used in areas
        that are used as walking paths or outdoor seating areas. The main projects that I do
        with pavers are walkways, firepits, and outdoor patios.

        <a href="products/block.php">Block</a><br>
        Block is mainly used for retaining walls or freestanding walls depending on the type. Some projects
        that retaining walls can be used for is for raised gardens, terracing, and to go alongside steps. Free
        standing walls can be used along patios, firepits, or walkways and can be multipurposed as a seating area
        as well as a wall.

        Rocks are a versatile material and can be used for many different things depending on the size of the rock. 
        Some of the most common things that I use it for are walls, shorelines, and edging.

        Mulch is just woodchips that can be dyed to come in a multitude of colors. I mostly use mulch along houses
        and in gardens as the top layer to make things look nice.

        Flagstone is rock that is split into layers making it flatter than just an ordinary rock but still
        giving a natural look. I used flagstone mainly for stepping stones or for walkways.

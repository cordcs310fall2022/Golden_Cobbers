        A patio is most often made using pavers and gives you, your family, and any guests you have
        a nice, flat place to sit and visit.

        Walkways and sidewalks provide a nice path for you to walk on around your yard. Most walkways I
        do are made using pavers, but I also do flagstone walkways for a more natural look.

        Firepits are very similar to patios in that they are made using pavers and are a good place to 
        sit and visit with company. The main difference is that they are circular and have a firepit in
        the middle for you and your company to enjoy the warmth of a fire while visiting.

        <a href="services/wall.php">Wall</a><br>
        There are many different types of walls that can be used for different purposes. Retaining walls can
        be used to terrace things and create more usable space in your yard. Rock walls can provide a natural
        look and be used for similar purposes as retaining walls. There are also free standing walls that can
        be used as walls and seating areas along walkways or patios.

        <a href="services/shoreline.php">Shoreline</a><br>
        On shorelines I use rock to keep them natural and prevent erosion. The way that I do this
        is by using riprap. riprap is basically using a bunch of rock to create a natural slope up
        to your shoreline that allows ice to slide up it instead of pushing into it.
